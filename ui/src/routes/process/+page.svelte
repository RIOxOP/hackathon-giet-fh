        Keeping You Safe Online: How We Score Websites?
    </h1>
    <p>
        We all know the feeling of clicking on a link and ending up somewhere strange. At secure Secure Guardian, your online safety is our priority. That's why we created a scoring system that checks websites and tells you how trustworthy they are. Here's how it works:
    </p>
    
    <h2 class={h2style}>
        1. Teaching Our Super Tool:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Imagine a giant brain that learns from tons of examples. We feed it information about safe and unsafe websites, and it figures out what makes a website good or bad. We use clever tools called "machine learning algorithms" to do this, like a super smart teacher!
    </p>

    2. Finding the Clues:  
</h2>
    <p>
        Once our super tool is trained, it identifies important clues that help it decide if a website is safe. These clues are like pieces of a puzzle that tell the story of the website. We use parameters like-  Trusted website lists, Government blacklists ,Website age, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, Pop-up ads, Redirects, Unusual URLs, Spelling and grammar.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class={h2style}>
        3. Putting it All Together:
    </h2>
    <p>
        When you enter a website address (URL), our system gathers information about that website based on those clues. Then, it uses a special program to combine all this information and give the website a score. 
    </p>
    
    <h2 class={h2style}>
        4. What the Score Means:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The score you see is a simple number that tells you how safe the website is. We use words like "Safe," "Use with Caution," or "Avoid This Website" to make it easy to understand.
    </p>

    <h2 class={h2style}>
        5.  Beyond the Score:
    </h2>
    <p>
        The score is a helpful guide, but it's always good to be careful online. If something feels off about a website, trust your gut and don't click!
